Hi, I'm Ben! I am a seasoned software engineer, and I'm here to share my tech adventures with you on this blog. Join me as I dive into new technologies, stumble upon quirky bugs, and explore intriguing edge cases.

When I'm not lost in lines of code, you'll catch me on the volleyball court, or being vexed by my two cats.
