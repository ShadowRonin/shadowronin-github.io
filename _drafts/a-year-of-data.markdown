## Job search

Both in 2023 and 2024, I changed jobs. When I was searching I used [huntr.co](https://huntr.co/) to keep track of what companies I applied too. It is basically just a kanban board to keep track of jobs you've applied too, interviews, offers, and rejections. In the past I've seen some [cool graphics](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/b5sfbh/my_12month_job_search_as_a_recent_graduate_in/) [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1bvpom0/6_months_of_job_huntinga_sankey_chart/) and learned this is a [sankey diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram). Decided to make my own, so I downloaded my huntr data and made a [tiny python project](https://github.com/ShadowRonin/sankey-huntr) to create the diagrams.

### 2023 Job Hunt

After being laid off in 2023, I started applying to any job that fit my skills. This led to 177 applications, 9 first round interviews, 4 second round interviews, and 3 third and forth round interviews. Eventually only one of those led to an offer.

### 2024 Jub Hunt

During a short beach trip, I decided to look for a better fitting position. I was much more discerning in my search, in general each job I applied for was one that either:
- Had a record of great work life balance
- Paid extremely well
- Or was in another country (mostly Germany)

In total I applied for 62 jobs, of those I only got one interview, which has 2 rounds, before getting an offer.

### Next Time
Next time I search for a job (which hopfully wont be anytime soon, as I quite like my new position) I would change a few things. First, I would be more consistent with collecting data. I know for both of these there were some jobs not counted, many quick apply ones in linkedin. I also did not track my interactions with recruiters. I would also keep a better track of job details. When I started my search I was saving the job name, and the link to the application page, but as time went on I just saved the company name, and left a generic job title. It would be nice to simplify this data collection, maybe I could make something that would take a link to a job application, and fill in all of the info into the board. Then all I would have to do is paste that link, and keep track of interviews.
